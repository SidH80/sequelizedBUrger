# Eat Da Burger Sequalized!

* Eat Da Burger Sequalized! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* This will query every burger in a database using Sequeilize.

* It is deployed on Heroku and uses JawsDB for deployed hosting whether devoured or not.
